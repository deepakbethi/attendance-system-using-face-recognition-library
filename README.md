# attendance-system-using-face-recognition-library

first we need to install opencv,dlib,face_recognition libraries

OPENCV:

The project involved in taking pictures of students using web cams and analysing them. We used “OpenCV” as image processing software.
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems.

DLIB:

Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. It is used in both industry and academia in a wide range of domains including robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance computing environments.

FACE_RECOGNITION:


Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world’s simplest face recognition library.Built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning
The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on theLabeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

by using open cv and face_recognition we will encode and detect the face features such as eyes,nose etc
if those features matches with our real time image we will mark the attendance in an csv file
